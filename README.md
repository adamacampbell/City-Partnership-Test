# Assumtions
## 1. User Will Have Own FCA API Credentials
For development, I will store my FCA credentials as .env variables. However, users should use the configured API call to set up their FCA credentials (Email and API key).
## 2. Authentication for my API will not be required.
Due to the 'Simple' nature of the project, I have opted out of implementing authentication as it was not mentioned in the spec.
## 3. User will have Docker installed to host project.
Docker was mentionned in the spec, to allow for the project to be reusable. Full disclosure, I had to follow a tutorial to set this up as I'm fairly new to configuring Docker. Apologies in advance if I have done this incorrectly.
## 4. Use of '-' in URLs.
Everyone has their own preferences regarding the use of separators in URLs, I tend to use '-'. I'm not string minded on this and will use whatever other devs are strong minded on (less hassle), but Google do refer to the use of '-' as acceptable.
