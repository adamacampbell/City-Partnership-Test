## 1. User Will Have Own FCA API Credentials
For development, I will store my FCA credentials as .env variables. However, users should use the configured API call to set up their FCA credentials (Email and API key).
## 2. Authentication for my API will not be required.
Due to the 'Simple' nature of the project, I have opted out of implementing authentication as it was not mentioned in the spec.
